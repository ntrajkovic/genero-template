          <h2 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-deep-orange">Editorial Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>The International Advisory Board is an advisory body that actively contributes to the development of the journal. The tasks and duties of the International Advisory Board include: the support to the development of the journal, its promotion, encouraging experts in the area of gender studies, feminist theory and cultural studies to get involved as journal’s authors and/or reviewers, writing editorials, reviews, etc.</p>
          <p>The Editor-in-Chief is responsible for deciding which articles submitted to GENERO will be published. The Editor-in-Chief and Editorial Board are guided by the Editorial Policy and constrained by legal requirements in force regarding libel, copyright infringement and plagiarism.</p>
          <p>The Editor-in-Chief reserves the right to decide not to publish submitted manuscripts in case it is found that they do not meet relevant standards concerning the content and formal aspects. The Editorial Staff will inform the authors whether the manuscript is accepted for publication within three months from the date of the manuscript submission.</p>
          <p>Editor-in-Chief and Editorial Board must hold no conflict of interest with regard to the articles they consider for publication. In case one or more members of the Editorial Staff hold a conflict of interest regarding a submitted manuscript, these members of the Editorial Staff shall withdraw from the selection of reviewers and all decisions related to the manuscript.</p>
          <p>Editor-in-Chief and Editorial Board shall evaluate manuscripts for their intellectual content free from any racial, gender, sexual, religious, ethnic, or political bias.</p>
          <p>The Editor and the Editorial Staff must not use unpublished materials disclosed in submitted manuscripts without the express written consent of the authors. The information and ideas presented in submitted manuscripts shall be kept confidential and must not be used for personal gain.</p>
          <p>Editors and the Editorial Staff shall take all reasonable measures to ensure that the reviewers remain anonymous to the authors before, during and after the evaluation process and the authors remain anonymous to reviewers until the end of the review procedure.</p>

        <!-- Authors’ Responsibilities -->
        <section id="authors-responsibilities">
          <h2 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-deep-orange">Authors’ Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>Authors warrant that their manuscript is their original work, that it has not been published before and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere. Parallel submission of the same paper to another journal constitutes a misconduct and eliminates the manuscript from consideration by GENERO.</p>
          <p>The Authors also warrant that the manuscript is not and will not be published elsewhere (after the publication in GENERO) in any language without the consent of the Publisher.</p>
          <p>In case a submitted manuscript is a result of a research project, or its previous version has been presented at a conference in the form of an oral presentation (under the same or similar title), detailed information about the project, the conference, etc. shall be provided in the footnote at the beginning of the text. A paper that has already been published in another journal cannot be reprinted in GENERO.</p>
          <p>It is the responsibility of each author to ensure that papers submitted to GENERO are written with ethical standards in mind. Authors affirm that the article contains no unfounded or unlawful statements and does not violate the rights of third parties. The Publisher will not be held legally responsible should there be any claims for compensation.</p>
          <h3>Reporting standards</h3>
          <p>A submitted manuscript should contain sufficient detail and references to permit reviewers and, subsequently, readers to verify the claims presented in it. The deliberate presentation of false claims is a violation of ethical standards. Book reviews should be accurate and they should present an objective perspective.</p>
          <p>Authors are exclusively responsible for the contents of their submissions and must make sure that they have permission from all involved parties to make the data public.</p>
          <p>Authors wishing to include figures, tables or other materials that have already been published elsewhere are required to obtain permission from the copyright holder(s). Any material received without such evidence will be assumed to originate from the authors.</p>
          <h3>Authorship</h3>
          <p>Authors must make sure that all only contributors who have significantly contributed to the submission are listed as authors and, conversely, that all contributors who have significantly contributed to the submission are listed as authors. If persons other than authors were involved in important aspects of the research project and the preparation of the manuscript, their contribution should be acknowledged in a footnote or the Acknowledgments section.</p>
          <h3>Acknowledgment of Sources</h3>
          <p>Authors are required to properly cite sources that have significantly influenced their research and their manuscript. Information received in a private conversation or correspondence with third parties, in reviewing project applications, manuscripts and similar materials, must not be used without the express written consent of the information source.</p>
          <h3>Plagiarism</h3>
          <p>Plagiarism, where someone assumes another's ideas, words, or other creative expression as one's own, is a clear violation of scientific ethics. Plagiarism may also involve a violation of copyright law, punishable by legal action.</p>
          <p>Plagiarism includes the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Word for word, or almost word for word copying, or purposely paraphrasing portions of another author's work without clearly indicating the source or marking the copied fragment (for example, using quotation marks);</li>
            <li>Copying equations, figures or tables from someone else's paper without properly citing the source and/or without permission from the original author or the copyright holder.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Any paper which shows obvious signs of plagiarism will be automatically rejected.</p>
          <p>In case plagiarism is discovered in a paper that has already been published by the journal, it will be retracted in accordance with the procedure described below under Retraction policy, and authors will be permanently forbidden to publish in GENERO.</p>
          <h3>Conflict of interest</h3>
          <p>Authors should disclose in their manuscript any financial or other substantive conflict of interest that might have influenced the presented results or their interpretation.</p>
          <h3>Fundamental errors in published works</h3>
          <p>When an author discovers a significant error or inaccuracy in his/her own published work, it is the author’s obligation to promptly notify the journal Editor or publisher and cooperate with the Editor to retract or correct the paper.</p>
          <p>By submitting a manuscript the authors agree to abide by the journal GENERO's Editorial Policies.</p>

          <h2 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-deep-orange">Reviewers’ Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>Reviewers are required to provide written, competent and unbiased feedback in a timely manner on the scholarly merits and the scientific value of the manuscript.</p>
          <p>The reviewers assess manuscript for the compliance with the profile of the journal, the relevance of the investigated topic and applied methods, the originality and scientific relevance of information presented in the manuscript, the presentation style and scholarly apparatus.</p>
          <p>Reviewers should alert the Editor to any well-founded suspicions or the knowledge of possible violations of ethical standards by the authors. Reviewers should recognize relevant published works that have not been cited by the authors and alert the Editor to substantial similarities between a reviewed manuscript and any manuscript published or under consideration for publication elsewhere, in the event they are aware of such. Reviewers should also alert the Editor to a parallel submission of the same paper to another journal, in the event they are aware of such.</p>
          <p>Reviewers must not have conflict of interest with respect to the research, the authors and/or the funding sources for the research. If such conflicts exist, the reviewers must report them to the Editor without delay.</p>
          <p>Any selected referee who feels unqualified to review the research reported in a manuscript or knows that its prompt review will be impossible should notify the Editor without delay.</p>
          <p>Reviews must be conducted objectively. Personal criticism of the author is inappropriate. Reviewers should express their views clearly with supporting arguments.</p>
          <p>Any manuscripts received for review must be treated as confidential documents. Reviewers must not use unpublished materials disclosed in submitted manuscripts without the express written consent of the authors. The information and ideas presented in submitted manuscripts shall be kept confidential and must not be used for personal gain.</p>

        <section id="peer-review">
          <h2 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-deep-orange">Peer Review</h2>
          <p>The submitted manuscripts are subject to a peer review process. The purpose of peer review is to assists the Editor in making editorial decisions and through the editorial communications with the author it may also assist the author in improving the paper.</p>
          <p>The submitted manuscripts are passed on to two (2) anonymous referees, chosen based on their research competence and fields of research. Within 30 days manuscripts are returned to the Editor. Referees evaluate the papers according to several criteria, as listed in the <i>Blind Review Form</i>.</p>
          <p>The choice of reviewers is at the Editors' discretion. The reviewers must be knowledgeable about the subject area of the manuscript; they must not be from the authors' own institution and they should not have recent joint publications with any of the authors.</p>
          <p>In the main review phase, the Editor sends submitted manuscripts to two experts in the field. The reviewers’ evaluation form (Blind Review Form) contains a checklist in order to help referees cover all aspects that can decide the fate of a submission. In the final section of the evaluation form, the reviewers must include observations and suggestions aimed at improving the submitted manuscript; these are sent to authors, without the names of the reviewers.</p>
          <p>All of the reviewers of a manuscript remain anonymous to the authors before, during and after the evaluation process.</p>
          <p>All of the reviewers of a manuscript remain anonymous to the authors before, during and after the evaluation process and the authors remain anonymous to reviewers until the end of the review procedure.</p>
          <p>All of the reviewers of a paper act independently and they are not aware of each other’s identities. If the decisions of the two reviewers are not the same (accept / reject), the Editor may assign additional reviewers.</p>
          <p>During the review process Editor may require authors to provide additional information (including raw data) if they are necessary for the evaluation of the scholarly merit of the manuscript. These materials shall be kept confidential and must not be used for personal gain.</p>
          <p>The Editorial team shall ensure reasonable quality control for the reviews. With respect to reviewers whose reviews are convincingly questioned by authors, special attention will be paid to ensure that the reviews are objective and high in academic standard. When there is any doubt with regard to the objectivity of the reviews or quality of the review, additional reviewers will be assigned.</p>

          <h2 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-deep-orange">Procedures for Dealing With Unethical Behaviour</h2>
          <p>Anyone may inform the editors and / or Editorial Staff at any time of suspected unethical behaviour or any type of misconduct by giving the necessary information / evidence to start an investigation.</p>
          <h3>Investigation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Editor-in-Chief will consult with the Editorial Board on decisions regarding the initiation of an investigation.</li>
            <li>During an investigation, any evidence should be treated as strictly confidential and only made available to those strictly involved in investigating.</li>
            <li>The accused will always be given the chance to respond to any charges made against them.</li>
            <li>If it is judged at the end of the investigation that misconduct has occurred, then it will be classified as either minor or serious.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Minor misconduct</h3>
          <p>Minor misconduct will be dealt directly with those involved without involving any other parties, e.g.:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Communicating to authors / reviewers whenever a minor issue involving misunderstanding or misapplication of academic standards has occurred.</li>
            <li>A warning letter to an author or reviewer regarding fairly minor misconduct.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Major misconduct</h3>
          <p>The Editor-in-Chief, in consultation with the Editorial Board, and, when appropriate, further consultation with a small group of experts should make any decision regarding the course of action to be taken using the evidence available. The possible outcomes are as follows (these can be used separately or jointly):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Publication of a formal announcement or editorial describing the misconduct.</li>
            <li>Informing the author's (or reviewer's) head of department or employer of any misconduct by means of a formal letter.</li>
            <li>The formal, announced retraction of publications from the journal in accordance with the Retraction Policy (see below).</li>
            <li>A ban on submissions from an individual for a defined period.</li>
            <li>Referring a case to a professional organization or legal authority for further investigation and action.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>When dealing with unethical behaviour, the Editorial Staff will rely on the guidelines and recommendations provided by the <a href="http://publicationethics.org/resources/" target="_blank">Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)</a>.</p>

          <h2 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-deep-orange">Retraction Policy</h2>
          <p>Legal limitations of the publisher, copyright holder or author(s), infringements of professional ethical codes, such as multiple submissions, bogus claims of authorship, plagiarism, fraudulent use of data or any major misconduct require retraction of an article. Occasionally a retraction can be used to correct errors in submission or publication. The main reason for withdrawal or retraction is to correct the mistake while preserving the integrity of science; it is not to punish the author.</p>
          <p>Standards for dealing with retractions have been developed by a number of library and scholarly bodies, and this practice has been adopted for article retraction by GENERO: in the electronic version of the retraction note, a link is made to the original article. In the electronic version of the original article, a link is made to the retraction note where it is clearly stated that the article has been retracted. The original article is retained unchanged, save for a watermark on the PDF indicating on each page that it is “retracted.”</p>
